This is an information visualization of education's socioeconomic values.

We are basing part of the visualization on the 3dcube from paulrhayes.com Experiments

#Progress

##Start of project to Present

We initially began with the idea of analyzing informal education. But due to lack of available information, we decided to focus on formal education. Particularly in levels of education attained compared to income level. But we found that this has already been done and was talked about in class. 

We then took the approach of finding easily available information in education and seeing what we could do with it. Currently we are looking for correlations between income level, involvement in extracurricular activities, metro or rural school type, private or public school type, and academic performance. 

Some of the questions we are trying to answer currently are as follows and are subject to change:

1. Influence of income in extracurricular involvement 
2. Influence of metro or non metro type of school in extra curricular involvement
3. Influence of extracurricular involvement on academic performance

##01 Nov
We're still organizing a lot of the data via Google Drive spreadsheets as an easy-to-access database. Using Paul Hayes' 3d cube project (see demo/cube_platform.png) , we can line up our visualizations so that each rotation axis corresponds to a variable.
